Mechanics - Mechanical Simulations 
=====================================================================

Mechanical module to perform purely mechanical simulations developed by Maria Giuseppina Chiara Nestola and Marco Favino.
The module can be loaded in whale framework.

Technical comments:
mech.mk is needed to have mechanics as a MOOSE module. ( *.o;  *.opt ;  *.d  files created).
The Makefile is needed to have a stand alone MOOSE-based application ( executable  mech-opt and  *.opt ;  *.d  files created).

The software is realized with NO WARRANTY and it is licenzed under BSD 3-Clause license
